    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Daily Kanji is a web-app that generate random kanji cards to help you memorize them. The database used here is the Jōyō kanji database from <a href='http://www.kanjidatabase.com/'>www.kanjidatabase.com</a>.</p>
    <p>This is not a proper educational tool and should probably not be treated as such. As it is now, it's merely a way to learn new kanjis from the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C5%8Dy%C5%8D_kanji'>jōyō set</a>.</p>
    <p> I mostly started this project as a way to delve into web technologies. You can learn more about the reasonning behind this on <a href='http://www.abak.io'>my personnal page</a> or browse the code of this project on <a href='https://github.com/abak/dailykanji'>github</a>.
