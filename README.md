Daily Kanji
=====================

##First fact
Kanjis are hard. They all look the same, they have lots of different meanings, and lots of different pronunciations. Kanjis are so hard, that understanding the common set of 2136 kanjis is part of the final exams people take at the end of highschool.

##Second Fact
I never had the opportunity to try wed development, and it kinda look like black magic to me.

## Introducing Daily Kanji
Armed with these twos facts, here is Daily Kanji, a current version is [available](https://dailykanji.herokuapp.com/). A web application, probably full of bad design decision and poor technology choices.
